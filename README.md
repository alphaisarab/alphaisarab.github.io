alphaisarab is a simple, **FREE**, unblocked gaming website directed for places that has ~~restrictions~~ on certain, suspicious websites. This project is designed for people who want to **have fun** but have *certain restrictions* on *certain websites* during school, work, etc you get the point. Learning is **_bullshit_**, but having fun is more **important.**

Our project is *open-source* and *will be open-source.* We don't know who you are at this point, take a game for your website. Gatekeeping is **stupid**.
